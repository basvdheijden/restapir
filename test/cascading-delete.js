/**
 * @doc queries/cascading-deletes
 * # Cascading deletes
 *
 * This plugin can delete content that refers to deleted content. If A has a
 * reference to B, then A can be set up to be automatically deleted when
 * B is deleted.
 *
 * Add the ``cascade`` property on a reference field to activate this plugin.
 * All cascading references must have a reverse link as well.
 *
 * ```
 * name: Post
 * properties:
 *   title:
 *     type; string
 *   author:
 *     type: string
 *     references: User
 *     reverse: posts
 *     cascade: before
 * ```
 *
 * All posts of a specific author are deleted when the User is deleted.
 * Posts are attempted to be deleted before User is deleted. The query is
 * rejected in case of failures (including permission errors). Note that
 * there is no transaction support. The deleted posts will not get restored
 * when the User cannot be deleted.
 * The value "after" can also be used. Posts are deleted after User in this
 * case, leaving all posts intact when User could not be deleted. This however
 * will leave us with posts referencing to non-existent users in case a
 * delete post failed.
